This sphere was created in TinkerCad as 20x20x20mm and exported as a single object to .obj and .mtl

So using a 20x20x20mm sphere in tindercad exported as .obj

With out a scale attribute, it's HUGE in WebXR. Why?

I'm going back to make it small 1x1x1mm and then import it. Still HUGE? 

No, as you decrease the size in TinkerCad the object gets smaller in XR.

But the poitioning is strange =(

You can move it using positioning but it doesn't seem to move much. 

I'm going to try scaling it down. 

Strange the scale changes the position, even if the position attr never changes, for instance if I go from .5 to .05 it moves the object off to the left`
