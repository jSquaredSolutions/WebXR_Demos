A-Frame Naviation Mesh
====================

Building virtual reality experiances for the Web is a blast. Soon after you conquer the basics, you might be saying to yourself - "Ok, now I want to move around in my VR world". To achieve this you'll use A-Frame extras. Viola, now you can move forward, back, left or right. You can even FLY! After learning how to implement the movement control, I wanted to understand how to use nav-mesh.

So I reviewed these two articles:
1 https://ada.is/blog/2018/02/12/how-i-built-a-game-in-a-week/
2 https://www.donmccurdy.com/2017/08/20/creating-a-nav-mesh-for-a-webvr-scene/

I set out with two goals in mind.

1. I want to take a plane and make a nav mesh
2. I want to figure out how to walk uphill
